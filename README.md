# CSU44052 Computer Graphics
## Final Project

This is my Final Project for CSU44052 Computer Graphics. It depicts an infinitely generating scene that demonstrates numerous OpenGL features such as geometry rendering, texture mapping, lighting and shadows, animation, instancing and particle systems. 

### Compilation instructions
*Requires CMAKE and WSL/Linux*
- Open a Command Line Terminal in the root directory.
- Execute `mkdir build` to create the build directory.
- Execute `cd build` to enter the build directory.
- Execute `cmake ..` inside the build directory to generate the makefile.
- Execute `make` inside the build directory to compile the application.
- Execute `./final_project` to run the application.

## Specification

In the final project, you will develop a computer graphics application to showcase the
techniques you have learned in the module in a single framework.

The project title is **Toward a Futuristic Emerald Isle**. This project is
strictly individual (no groupwork). Your project will be demonstrated in your project
deliverables, but you may additionally be required to demonstrate your working program
to the lecturer upon request.

Your application should include the following features:
- The application is implemented in C/C++, using shader-based OpenGL 3.3.
- A minimum frame rate of 15 FPS must be achieved, when running on the latest
generation of GPU (i.e., a desktop 4090). Refer to Lab 4 on how frame rate is
calculated and displayed in the window title.
- The application should demonstrate an infinite scene. The camera should be
controllable (using up, down, left, right keys or mouse buttons). When the camera
moves, the application should simulate an endingless effect, demonstrating that the
camera can move without going out of the scene.
- The application should include the four basic features covered in Lab 1, 2, 3, 4:
geometry rendering, texture mapping, lighting and shadow, and animation.
- The application should allow user interaction and camera-control. User should be
able to move around the scene using the keyboard and/or the mouse. At a minimum,
implement moving forwards and backwards, turning left and turning right.
- The application should include an implementation of one of the following advanced
features that are not discussed in the class. For other features you are welcome to
discuss with the lecturer before implementing them.
  - Deferred shading
  - Screen-space ambient occlusion
  - Screen-space depth of field
  - Environment lighting
  - Level of details
  - Instancing
  - Real-time global illumination, e.g., voxel cone tracing
  - Physics-based animation, e.g., particle systems, smoothed particle hydrodynamics
  - Support multi-platform graphics: Android/iOS, WebGL, AR/VR.
